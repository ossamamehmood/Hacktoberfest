# GUI QUIZ APPLICATION USING TKINTER LIBRARY IN PYTHON

This is a standard quiz application that presents a set of carefully curated questions to the users (a questionnaire), allows them to answer the same, and displays the correct answer if they are wrong. 

Each test will display the final score of the user. 

The application will have an account creation option, wherein some users can be appointed as Admins
