<b><i>Email Directory App(NATIVE ANDROID APP)</i></b>

<b> Problem Statement: </b>

I have observed that when a person is in a corporate world, they are Swamped, and sometimes it is challenging to keep track of emails of essential persons, maybe their boss or 
an important client.<br>
In college life, one needs to keep track of all professors' email IDs, which sometimes becomes cumbersome.<br>
Technology plays an important part in day-to-day operations, which has resulted in significant changes in many domains of employment, one of which is Mobile Application.
So mobile applications are extensively utilised and are recognised for their ease of use, they may be employed efficiently for this job.

<b> Proposed Solution : </b>

This project proposes an " Email tracking system" to keep track of all the college/corporate necessary email ids. Its features include updating an email information if they typed it wrong. Also, there is a facility to delete the entry if one feels it's incorrect. The project's scope is not limited to college but can also be used in the corporate lifestyle.

<b> Functionality & Concepts used : </b>

The app offers a very simple and engaging layout that allows students and corporate employees to save, manage, and even remove critical email IDs. The following are a few Android principles that were employed to create the app's functionalities:
<br>

<i>Room Database& LiveData</i> : We also use LiveData to update and preserve any changes made by the user, as well as to update local databases through Room..<br>
<i>Constraint Layout</i> :The majority of the app's activities employ a flexible constraint layout that is simple to adjust for different screen sizes.<br>
<i>ViewModel</i> : The ViewModel class is in charge of preparing and managing data for an Activity.<br>
<i>Recyclerview</i> : This helps to represent a scrolable list of email ID's entered by the User<br>

The App has two screens. <br>
