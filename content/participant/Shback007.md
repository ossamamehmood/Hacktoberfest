# Sagnik Hore - Portfolio

## Introduction
Hello! I'm Sagnik Hore, a Computer Science undergraduate student with a passion for software development and cybersecurity. Welcome to my portfolio, where you can get a glimpse of my projects and interests.

## About Me
- **Name:** Sagnik Hore
- **Academic Background:** Computer Science Undergraduate Student

## Interests
I have a keen interest in two main areas:
- **Development:** I love building software applications, solving problems, and working on projects that have a meaningful impact. My programming skills include languages like Python, Java, and JavaScript.
- **Cybersecurity:** The ever-evolving world of cybersecurity fascinates me. I enjoy learning about security threats and best practices to protect systems and data.

## Projects
Here are some of the projects I've worked on:
1. [Tic-Tac-Toe](https://shback007.github.io/Tic-Tac-Toe/):The Tic Tac Toe Game is a simple web-based implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game. It allows two players to take turns marking 'X' or 'O' on a 3x3 grid. The game determines the winner based on a line of three identical symbols in a row, column, or diagonal, or declares a draw when the grid is filled without a winner.
