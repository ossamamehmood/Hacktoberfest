  <summary>🌈 A Bit of Background</summary>

  I was born in Redding, CA, but escaped to Chico where I discovered a love for life, music, art, and creativity. I even did a stint as a barista and earned the social media handle [@thecoffeejesus](https://www.twitter.com/thecoffeejesus). You can find me under the same name on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/thecoffeejesus), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ctavolazzi), and [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/thecoffeejesus).
